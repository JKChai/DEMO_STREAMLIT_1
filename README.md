# README 

This is a quick app built with Streamlit to experiment with some of the streamlit features slicing/filtering through data.

Here is the link to view this APP on Streamlit Community: https://demoapp1-pkxjygmm3era9d3zmctappk.streamlit.app/

## THEME 

The idea is to build an APP that allow users who build products to look at their products data based on the store that they selected, the date via slicing window, and the minimum cost of the product. 

To make it easier for the developer to monitor the performance and debug this APP, some metadata info are provided
* the amount of time to run the table (note that the table is being cached), 
* the number of rows and columns before and after filtering, and 
* some unique fields information are provided.

## Data

The data is Contoso Retail Fact Sales table, a demo dataset from Microsoft, modified by a Kaggle User: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanuthakurr/cleaned-contoso-dataset
